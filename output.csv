Even very large cargoes such as many pathogens, mRNAs and pre-ribosomal subunits can pass the NPC intact. Compared to small import complexes, for such large cargoes >15 nm there is very little quantitative understanding of the mechanism for efficient transport, the role of multivalent binding to nuclear transport receptors via nuclear localisation sequences (NLSs) and effects of size differences. Here, we assayed nuclear import kinetics in cells for a total of 30 large cargo models based on four capsid-like particles in the size range of 17-36 nm, with tuneable numbers of up to 240 NLSs. We show that the requirements for transport can be recapitulated by a simple two-parameter biophysical model that allow us to correlate the import flux to the energetic requirements for nuclear transport. Together, our results reveal key molecular determinants of large cargo import in cells.\t\t\t\nStudy Key Words\tlarge cargo\tnuclear import kinetics\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Organism\tHomo sapiens\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Organism Term Source REF\tNCBITaxon\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Organism Term Accession\t9606\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Experiments Number\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy External URL\t\n\nStudy BioImage Archive Accession\n\t\t\t\t\nStudy Public Release Date\t2020-07-22'

 '.5 %. Higher time resolution would increase the sensitivity to even more subtle delays but increase overall data volume. Illumination of the specimen was reduced to the minimum necessary for sufficient signal to noise ratio for automated phenotyping (see below) with exposure times of 18-50 ms (GFP). Data was compressed without loss (ZIP) on the fly, buffered locally on the microscope computers and then saved on a 5 TB network-attached-storage. Microscopes were connected via a 2 GBit/s network to the NAS to sustain uninterrupted data flow.\tTo automatically score and annotate phenotypes in this large data set, we developed a computational pipeline2 (Fig. 1) extending previously established methods of morphology recognition by supervised machine learning3-6. In brief, after segmentation, about 200 quantitative features were extracted from each nucleus and used for classification into one of 16 morphological classes (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Movies 1-30) by a support vector machine classifier previously trained on a set of ~3,000 manually annotated nuclei (Supplementary Methods). This classifier automatically recognizes changes in nuclear morphology due to the cell cycle, cell death or other phenotypic changes with an overall accuracy of 87% (Supplementary Fig. 1) and allows us to convert each time-lapse movie into a phenotypic profile that quantifies the response to each siRNA (Fig. 1a). In addition, the position of each nucleus is tracked over time. Using stringent significance thresholds for each morphological class, nuclear mobility as well as proliferation rate, significant and reproducible (majority of three or more technical replicates) deviations caused by each siRNA are computed (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Methods).'

To capture enough cells (n > 20) for the subsequent quantitative analysis, images were acquired at 4 or 16 non-overlapping positions in each well for the 10 x and 40 x objective, respectively. With this set-up, 48 or 192 images were acquired for each antibody. For each position, a low-resolution (16 x 16 pixels) autofocus procedure based on contrast from the microtubule antibody staining (contrast based method 1 in Leica Matrix Screener v.2.3.0) was applied using the 543 nm HeNe laser. Following this, a sequential acquisition of the three fluorophores was used to avoid cross talk with the following setup: a UV 405 nm diode laser for excitation of the DAPI staining of the nucleus, a 543 nm and 633 nm HeNe laser for excitation of the Alexa 555 and Alexa 647 secondary antibodies staining the microtubules (a-tubulin) and calreticulin in the endoplasmic reticulum (the latter used for normal variation study only), and a 488nm argon laser exciting the Alexa 488 secondary antibody for detection of the target protein. Before starting the automated acquisition, the detector gain was manually adjusted for each antibody using the staining of the negative control. To make best use of the dynamic range of the detec-or and to trace any potential decrease in staining intensity between the wells, the gain was adjusted to minimize the number of saturated pixels and use the full dynamic range of the detector. To allow quantitative relative measurements of staining intensity, the two siRNA samples and the control were always imaged with identical gain settings. To better visualize the degree of down-regulation as a result from quantitative imaging, a selected subset of antibodies were imaged manually at higher resolution using a 63x/ 1.4 N/A oil immersion objective, with the same parameters as for the automated setup.

Next, a long series was acquired at intermediate laser power, at a rate of 100 frames per second. To determine the minimal length of the series, which generates SR images of sufficient quality for single particle averaging, we reconstructed images of Nup133-FL-labled cells using a decreasing number of frames. We then averaged particles from these images and measured the average radial position of the Nup133-FL label (see: 'Iterative translational alignment' and 'Estimation of radial position and cross-validation analysis') and found that the measurement became stable above 20,000-40,000 frames. We therefore used only series with at least 40,000 frames for SR image reconstruction (Fig. S2A).  In order to facilitate the return of fluorophores to the ground state at a constant rate, the sample was illuminated with the 405 nm back-pumping laser; the gradual increase of the 405 nm laser intensity was achieved either manually or by the GSD Wizard's 'Auto Backpumping' feature.

To remove biases due to lower illumination intensity at the image border, 150 pixels were cropped on each side. Nuclei were segmented by adaptive thresholding of the Hoechst channel images with a window size of 10 by 10 pixels. The number of segmented nuclei was used as a proxy for cell count. Using the segmented nuclei as seeds, a cell segmentation mask was generated by extending the nuclei segmentation into a threshold mask of the actin channel using a Voronoi-based propagation algorithm.

A prominent example is the nuclear pore complex (NPC), for which the organization of its individual components remains unknown. By combining stochastic super-resolution microscopy, to directly resolve the ringlike structure of the NPC, with single particle averaging, to use information from thousands of pores, we determined the average positions of fluorescent molecular labels in the NPC with a precision well below 1 nanometer. Applying this approach systematically to the largest building block of the NPC, the Nup107-160 subcomplex, we assessed the structure of the NPC scaffold. Thus, light microscopy can be used to study the molecular organization of large protein complexes in situ in whole cells.\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Organism\tHomo sapiens\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Organism Term Source REF\tNCBITaxon\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Organism Term Accession\tNCBITaxon_9606\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Experiments Number\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy External URL\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Public Release Date\t2016-05-26\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n# Study Publication\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy PubMed ID\t23845946\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Publication Title\tNuclear pore scaffold structure analyzed by super-resolution microscopy and particle averaging.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Author List\tSzymborska A, de Marco A, Daigle N, Cordes VC, Briggs JA, Ellenberg J\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy PMC ID'
 '.  The secondary screen of proteins forming nuclear foci was conducted in untreated or IR_treated cells. Because 325 proteins con_ stitutively form nuclear foci in untreated or IR_treated cells, the validation of 325 proteins with nuclear foci localization was conducted manually using various markers of nuclear bodies or distinct nucleolus morphology in un_ treated cells. Considering that subcellular localizations of the various nuclear body markers we used are largely distinct from each other, we have not assessed colocalization of each gene with all six marker proteins se_ quentially. Instead, we scored a protein as positive for a particular nuclear body component in the case of it showing >70% overlapping with any marker protein. During the course of the analysis, we were aware that some proteins colocalize with both PML and paraspeckles, and therefore, we examined whether the identified PML proteins also localize to para_ speckles or vice versa. Eventually, eight proteins were found to localize in both nuclear subcompartments.'

Even very large cargoes such as many pathogens, mRNAs and pre-ribosomal subunits can pass the NPC intact. Compared to small import complexes, for such large cargoes >15 nm there is very little quantitative understanding of the mechanism for efficient transport, the role of multivalent binding to nuclear transport receptors via nuclear localisation sequences (NLSs) and effects of size differences. Here, we assayed nuclear import kinetics in cells for a total of 30 large cargo models based on four capsid-like particles in the size range of 17-36 nm, with tuneable numbers of up to 240 NLSs. We show that the requirements for transport can be recapitulated by a simple two-parameter biophysical model that allow us to correlate the import flux to the energetic requirements for nuclear transport. Together, our results reveal key molecular determinants of large cargo import in cells.\t\t\t\nStudy Key Words\tlarge cargo\tnuclear import kinetics\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Organism\tHomo sapiens\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Organism Term Source REF\tNCBITaxon\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Organism Term Accession\t9606\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Experiments Number\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy External URL\t\n\nStudy BioImage Archive Accession\n\t\t\t\t\nStudy Public Release Date\t2020-07-22'

Nuclei were segmented using DAPI (Channel 1) and cell bodies were detected by DHE (Channel 3). Subcellular regions include: ""nucleus"", ""ring region"" (-2 to -7 pixels from nucleus border), ""nucleus region"" (1 pixel erosion of nucleus), ""cytoplasm"", and ""membrane region"" (0 to 5 pixels inward from cell border).  The following morphological features were calculated: area, roundness (form factor), length, width, and length/width were determined for nucleus and cell regions, the ratio of nuclear area:cell area (""Nuc/Cell Area"") and areas of ring and membrane regions. The extent of cell-cell contact, i.e. ""Neighbor Fraction"", was calculated as follows: 1 - ((Outer Membrane Region area * 2) / (Inner Membrane Region area * 2)), where the ""Outer Membrane Region"" is a 1-pixel dilation from the cell edge and the ""Inner Membrane Region"" is a 1-pixel erosion from the cell edge.

However, such practical examples of phenotypic profiling of drug response published to date have largely been restricted to cell lines and phenotypic response markers that are amenable to basic cellular imaging. As such, these approaches preclude the analysis of both complex heterogeneous phenotypic responses and subtle changes in cell morphology across physiologically relevant cell panels. Here, we describe the application of a cell-based assay and custom designed image analysis algorithms designed to monitor morphologic phenotypic response in detail across distinct cancer cell types. We further describe the integration of these methods with automated data analysis workflows incorporating principal component analysis, Kohonen neural networking, and kNN classification to enable rapid and robust interrogation of such data sets. We show the utility of these approaches by providing novel insight into pharmacologic response across four cancer cell types, Ovcar3, MiaPaCa2, and MCF7 cells wild-type and mutant for p53. These methods have the potential to drive the development of a new generation of novel therapeutic classes encompassing pharmacologic compositions or polypharmacology in appropriate disease context.

 'Study Description\tDespite our rapidly growing knowledge about the human genome, we do not know all of the genes required for some of the most basic functions of life. To start to fill this gap we developed a high-throughput phenotypic screening platform combining potent gene silencing by RNA interference, time-lapse microscopy and computational image processing. We carried out a genome-wide phenotypic profiling of each of the approximately 21,000 human protein-coding genes by two-day live imaging of fluorescently labelled chromosomes. Phenotypes were scored quantitatively by computational image processing, which allowed us to identify hundreds of human genes involved in diverse biological functions including cell division, migration and survival.

 '. In total, we extracted, for each well, 385 quantitative phenotypic features (see publication Table EV3) The data were transformed using a generalized logarithm transformation (Huber et al., 2002)., 2013) and robust L1 regression to estimate the effects of the cell line and compound treatment using the medpolish function of the statistics package R (http://www.r-project.org). In this iterative approach row and column medians are subtracted alternately until the change in S, the sum of absolute residuals, divided by S, falls below the defined threshold of 0.0001. The final row and column values describe the compound and cell line effect, respectively. The residuals, either having a positive or a negative value, represent the interaction coefficients. This process was performed for each replicate and each feature individually. To account for the different proliferation rates of isogenic cell lines, the cell number values on the generalized logarithmic scale were normalized using the range defined by the median of the negative control values (1) and values of the compound taxol (0) for each cell line. Values below 0 and above 1 are possible. To detect significant interactions, the values of replicates were used to perform a moderated t-test against the null hypothesis u = 0 using the implementation of the lmFit and eBayes functions of the limma R package (Smyth, 2004) on the interaction matrix of each feature. p-values were adjusted for multiple testing by controlling for the false discovery rate (FDR) using the method of Benjamini & Hochberg (Benjamini, Y. & Hochberg, Y.) as previously described for the quantification of gene-gene interactions (Laufer et al., 2013).

However, variable genetic and phenotypic characterisation of many existing iPSC lines limits their potential use for research and therapy. Here, we describe the systematic generation, genotyping and phenotyping of 522 open access human iPSCs derived from 189 healthy male and female individuals as part of the Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Initiative (HipSci: http://www.hipsci.org). Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the major sources of genetic and phenotypic variation in iPSCs and establishes their suitability for use in genetic studies of complex human traits and cancer. Using a combination of genome- wide analyses we find that 5-25% of the variation in different iPSC phenotypes, including differentiation capacity and cellular morphology, arises from differences between individuals. We also assess the phenotypic effects of rare, genomic copy number mutations that are recurrently seen following iPSC reprogramming and present an initial map of common regulatory variants affecting the transcriptome of pluripotent cells in humans.\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Organism\tHomo sapiens\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Organism Term Source REF\tNCBITaxon\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Organism Term Accession\tNCBITaxon_9606\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Screens Number\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy External URL\thttp://www.hipsci.org/\t\t\nStudy BioImage Archive Accession\tS-BSMS5\nStudy Public Release Date\t2017-05-10'

However, for many functions, assay complexity and cost make genome-scale knockdown experiments impossible. Methods to predict genes required for cell functions are therefore needed to focus RNAi screens from the whole genome on the most likely candidates. Although different bioinformatics tools for gene function prediction exist, they lack experimental validation and are therefore rarely used by experimentalists. To address this, we developed an effective computational gene selection strategy that represents public data about genes as graphs and then analyzes these graphs using kernels on graph nodes to predict functional relationships. To demonstrate its performance, we predicted human genes required for a poorly understood cellular function \'mitotic chromosome condensation\' and experimentally validated the top 100 candidates with a focused RNAi screen by automated microscopy. Quantitative analysis of the images demonstrated that the candidates were indeed strongly enriched in condensation genes, including the discovery of several new factors. By combining bioinformatics prediction with experimental validation, our study shows that kernels on graph nodes are powerful tools to integrate public biological data and predict genes involved in cellular functions of interest.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Organism\tHomo sapiens\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Organism Term Source REF\tNCBITaxon']",[''],,0.833333333,1,0.903184307

To account for recovery, the sorbitol medium was replaced with fresh untreated medium for the set period of time. To induce oxidative stress, 0.5mM of sodium arsenite (Sigma) was added to the medium. To induce heat stress, cells were placed in an incubator at 42°C and 5% carbon dioxide for 1hr. For heat stress recovery, cells were returned to an incubator at 37°C and 5% carbon dioxide for the determined time. For immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature (RT). Cells were permeabilised and non-specific antibody binding was blocked using 0.3% Triton-X containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma) in PBS for 60 minutes.

All siRNAs were reconstituted in nuclease-free water in 1x buffer provided by the manufacturer. Each human gene was targeted using four independent siRNAs, each individually assessed in four separate wells, and, for genes in the actinome, with the addition of a fifth well containing those four siRNAs pooled together.The entire screen was performed in duplicate.

 'Study Description\tDespite our rapidly growing knowledge about the human genome, we do not know all of the genes required for some of the most basic functions of life. To start to fill this gap we developed a high-throughput phenotypic screening platform combining potent gene silencing by RNA interference, time-lapse microscopy and computational image processing. We carried out a genome-wide phenotypic profiling of each of the approximately 21,000 human protein-coding genes by two-day live imaging of fluorescently labelled chromosomes. Phenotypes were scored quantitatively by computational image processing, which allowed us to identify hundreds of human genes involved in diverse biological functions including cell division, migration and survival. As part of the Mitocheck consortium, this study provides an in-depth analysis of cell division phenotypes and makes the entire high-content data set available as a resource to the community.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Organism\tHomo sapiens\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Organism Term Source REF\tNCBITaxon'

However, variable genetic and phenotypic characterisation of many existing iPSC lines limits their potential use for research and therapy. Here, we describe the systematic generation, genotyping and phenotyping of 522 open access human iPSCs derived from 189 healthy male and female individuals as part of the Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Initiative (HipSci: http://www.hipsci.org). Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the major sources of genetic and phenotypic variation in iPSCs and establishes their suitability for use in genetic studies of complex human traits and cancer. Using a combination of genome- wide analyses we find that 5-25% of the variation in different iPSC phenotypes, including differentiation capacity and cellular morphology, arises from differences between individuals. We also assess the phenotypic effects of rare, genomic copy number mutations that are recurrently seen following iPSC reprogramming and present an initial map of common regulatory variants affecting the transcriptome of pluripotent cells in humans.\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Organism\tHomo sapiens\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Organism Term Source REF\tNCBITaxon\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Organism Term Accession\tNCBITaxon_9606\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy Screens Number\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStudy External URL\thttp://www.hipsci.org/\t\t\nStudy BioImage Archive Accession\tS-BSMS5\nStudy Public Release Date\t2017-05-10']",[''],,1,1,0.928585383
